**Context :** 
Face recognition is a biometric technique that determines whether the image of a 
person's face matches any of the face images stored in a database. 
The primary goal of this system is to build a face recognition-based attendance 
monitoring system for students in order to improve and upgrade the current attendance 
system to make it more efficient and effective than before. The student should be in an 
area containing light so that the detection can be clearly made. 

**Working of the System :** 
The facial recognition feature embedded in the attendance monitoring system not only 
ensures accurate attendance but also eliminates flaws. Using a system to overcome 
defects not only saves resources but also reduces human intervention in the overall 
process by delegating all complex tasks to the system. 
The student will need to register first to use the system using their name, photo and 
other additional details. They can manage their profile and view their attendance on the 
system. 
The admin can log in directly using their credentials. They can view the registered 
students and their details. The system will mark the attendance of students by detecting 
their faces using the webcam. The admin can view the attendance list of all the 
students. They can even search for the attendance of any students. 
The front end involves Html, CSS, and JavaScript and the back end involves Python. The 
framework used is Django and the database is MySQL. Libraries like OpenCV, Dlib, and 
Face-Recognition are used here. 

1) Advantages - No human intervention is required for marking attendance. - The system recognises faces and records attendance. - It prevents alteration with the attendance. - The student can also view their attendance. 
 
2) System Description 
The system comprises 1 major module with their sub-modules as follows:  
 Student: 
Registration: - The student will need to enter their username and capture a photo on the 
system. - They will also need to enter additional details. 
Login: - The student can log in using their credentials. 
Profile: - The student can manage their profile. 
View Attendance: - They can view their attendance here. 
 Admin: 
Login: - The admin can log in using their credentials. 
View Students: - The admin can view the registered users. 
Attendance: - The webcam will open and attendance will be marked after the student’s 
face is detected. 
View Attendance: - The admin can view the attendance list of all the students. - They can even search for an student’s attendance by their name. 

3) System Requirements 
I. Hardware Requirement 
 Windows 7 or higher 
 I3 processor system or higher 
 4 GB RAM or higher 
 100 GB ROM or higher 
 
II. Software Requirement 
 Python 
 MYSQL Sever 
 
4) Limitations/Disadvantages - To detect a face, the candidate must be in an area with light; otherwise, it 
will not be able to detect it.
